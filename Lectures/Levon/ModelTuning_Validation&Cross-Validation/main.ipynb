We see both errors decrease as alpha increases initially but then test error keeps going down while validation error rises again. It’s not perfect.

Each sample represents a much larger proportion of the data than say if we had a dataset with a million or more records.

    "As we saw in the post about train/test split, how you split smaller datasets makes a significant difference; the results can vary tremendously. As the random state is not a hyperparameter (seriously, please don’t do that), we need a way to extract every last bit of signal from the data that we possibly can. So instead of just one train/validation split, let’s do K of them.\n",

    "This technique is appropriately named K-fold cross-validation. Again, K represents how many train/validation splits you need. There’s no hard and fast rule about how to choose K but there are better and worse choices. As the size of your dataset grows, you can get away with smaller values for K, like 3 or 5. When your dataset is small, it’s common to select a larger number like 10. Again, these are just rules of thumb.\n",

    "The data included in the first validation fold will never be part of a validation fold again. A new validation fold is created, segmenting off the same percentage of data as in the first iteration. Then the process repeats - fit a fresh model, calculate key metrics, and iterate. The algorithm concludes when this process has happened K times. Therefore, you end up with K estimates of the validation error, having visited all the data points in the validation set once and numerous times in training sets. The last step is to average the validation errors for regression. This gives a good estimate as to how well a particular model will perform.\n",

    "Again, this method is invaluable for tuning hyperparameters on small to medium-sized datasets. You technically don’t even need a test set. That’s great if you just don’t have the data. For large datasets, use a simple train/validation/test split strategy and tune your hyperparameters like we did in the previous section.\n",

You may wonder why we get different values. The reason is that the data was split differently. We can control the splitting procedure with KFold but not cross_val_score. Therefore, there’s no way I know of to perfectly sync the two procedures without an exhaustive search of splits or writing the algorithm from scratch ourselves. The important thing is that each gives us a viable method to calculate whatever we need, whether it be purely validation error or a combination of training and validation error."

    "### Summary\n",
    "We discussed the Bias-Variance Tradeoff where a high bias model is one that is underfit while a high variance model is one that is overfit. We also learned that we can split data into three groups for tuning purposes. Specifically, the three groups are train, validation, and test. Remember the test set is used only one time to check how well a model generalizes on data it’s never seen. This three-group split works exceedingly well for large datasets but not for small to medium-sized datasets, though. In that case, use cross-validation (CV). CV can help you tune your models and extract as much signal as possible from the small data sample. Remember, with CV you don’t need a test set. By using a K-fold approach, you get the equivalent of K-test sets by which to check validation error. This helps you diagnose where you’re at in the bias-variance regime."
